1. A Callback

- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
- This technique allows a function to call another function
- A callback function can run after another function has finished
- It’s a way to ensure that certain code runs only after another piece of code has finished executing.

- Here's a simple analogy: Imagine you’re at a restaurant, and you place an order for food. 
- The restaurant kitchen prepares the food, and once it’s ready, they call you to let you know that your order is complete. 
- In this case, the act of calling you with the completed order is like a callback.


- Compared to the analogy above, lets put that in the context of javascript
- Suppose you want to retrieve some users from the database
- A function that retrieves it when it takes long to retrieve, 
- With callbacks we wont wait until it finishes retrieving
- Instead they execute something while they are still retrieving. Like wait... sth like that


In JavaScript, callbacks are often used in asynchronous operations, such as reading files, making network requests, or handling user interactions.
