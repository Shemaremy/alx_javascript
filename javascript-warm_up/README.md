# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------












1) DIFFERENCE BTN VAR, LET & CONST KEYWORDS TO DECLARE A VARIABLE
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
    a)  VAR  
        ----
- Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the function   where they are declared. If declared outside any function, they become globally scoped

- Variables declared with var can be redeclared and reassigned

If you are working with older code or need to maintain compatibility with scripts that were written before ECMAScript 6 (ES6), you might encounter the use of var.

Var was commonly used in older javascripts. wwith the new ones, its better to use let

 
 
 
 
 
    b) let and const
      ---------------
 - Variables declared with let can be reassigned or change values
 - Variables declared with const cant change their values or be reassigned












2) WAYS TO CONCACENATE IN THE OUTPUT (, or  +  or  $)
   -------------------------------------------------
   - Check file outputs.js
   - $ goes with (``). Keep in mind






3) OPERATOR PRECEDENCE
   --------------------
IRL, precedence is the condition of being considered more important than someone or something else

Operator precedence refers to the rules that determine the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression

- It is like BODMAS
- * has a higher precedence than +, and + higher than -



4) ARRAYS & FUNCTIONS
   ------------------
   No need to explain it more, it's same as in c++

5) DATATYPES IN JAVASCRIPT
   ------------------------
- There are two categories of datatypes in javascript
- Primitive datatypes and non primitive datatypes

- Primitive (They're 6): number, string, boolean, null, undefined, Symbol
- Non-primitive (They're many): objects, arrays, functions, Dates, RegExp(regular expression), maps, sets,...

- Check file objects.js to help u understand how objects work in javascript
