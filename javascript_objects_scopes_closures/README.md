# BY HERE WE WILL DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO CLASSES AND OBJECTS IN JAVASCRIPT (it is same as java)

1) HOW TO CREATE AN OBJECT
2) RULES OF A CONSTRUCTOR
3) HOW TO CALL MEMBERS OF A CLASS USING AN OBJECT
4) USE OF    (new)    KEYWORD
5) USE OF   (this)   KEYWORD
6) USE OF (super)   KEYWORD
7) INHERITANCE IN JAVASCRIPT

1) HOW TO CREATE AN OBJECT
---------------------------
We create an object by using a new keyword. 
ex: const x = new Flacko();               // Ensuring Flacko is a class and x is an object

- Objects are always declared as variables (It's better u assign objects as constants)
- What goes in the parameters will be passed in class constructor

## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





2) RULES OF A CONSTRUCTOR
--------------------------
- Name of a constructor is always: constructor
- They are invoked automatically at the born of new object
- Constructors do not have a return type


3) HOW TO CALL MEMBERS OF A CLASS USING AN OBJECT
4) USE OF    (new)    KEYWORD
5) USE OF   (this)   KEYWORD
6) USE OF (super)   KEYWORD
7) INHERITANCE IN JAVASCRIPT
